            <p>
                My first backpack I used was an old external frame backpack I borrowed from a friend.
                I needed a backpack for my three-week trip to Europe and at the time I was a broke college student.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then I've had a few different backpacks, most all of which have been Osprey backpacks because I like the ventilated back they offer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first backpack I bought was an 80L REI backpack that I bought from an REI Garage Sale.
                It was pretty beat-up when I bought it,
                but it was still in good enough condition to support me through a two week stint in New Zealand.
                Eventually the zipper broke on the front of the bag after snagging onto the weather stripping too many times and I decided it was time to buy a new backpack.

                As I've gradually transitioned to lighter gear, I've went through a number of Osprey backpacks.
                The first backpack I bought was an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Osprey-Packs-Backpacking-Mallard-Green/dp/B07GHQNYBX/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3F7I8KXR4STXR&keywords=osprey+rook+65&qid=1663541148&sprefix=osprey+rook+65%2Caps%2C199&sr=8-2&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840">Osprey Rook 65</a>.
                I purchased it because it's a great budget alternative to a similar backpack, the Osprey Atmos 65.
                I took the Osprey Rook 65 with me to Ventana Wilderness with my dog Gizmo and also up to Duck Pass in Mammoth.
                Overall, I think it's a great backpack, especially for the price, but I decided it was too large for the gear I was bringing with me.
                Also, I enjoy having an outside compartment I can easily stow away gear I need quit access to without having to take everything out of my bag.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next backpack I purchased was the Osprey Atmos 50.
                I purchased this backpack because of it's great reviews and it's anti-gravity suspension that's supposed to make heavy loads feel much lighter.
                I bought it on sale and didn't quite know which size to buy so I ended up buying a large.
                Both the Osprey Rook and the Atmos have an adjustable back-mesh panel so I figured the sizing wouldn't matter that much.
                Unfortunately, when I got the backpack. It was clear it was too large for me and I returned it.
                I think ultimately I made the right decision, because my baseweight is about 15 lbs. and the Osprey Atmos is a fairly heavy bag at a little over 4 lbs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next backpack I bought was the Osprey Exos 48 2018 model.
                I was kind of skeptical of the Osprey Exos at first because some people love it and others say it's very comfortable,
                but I decided to take a chance because it was the right balance for me between an ultralight backpack and a lightweight backpack.
                I was also considering the REI Flash and Gregory Optic since they're similar backpacks, but I decided to stick with Osprey since I have the most experience with their backpacks at this point and find them to be the most comfortable.
            </p>

                Overall, the Osprey Exos 48 2018 model was a nice weight savings from the Osprey Rook and Atmos.
                It had all the features I wanted, except it was lacking hip-belt pockets, which I shrugged off at first, but after taking it on a trip to Desolation Wilderness, decided they're definitely worth it.
                I tried using an Osprey lightweight fanny pack as a substitute for hip-belt pockets,
                but the backpack hip-belt overlaying the fanny pack belt was uncomfortable even when adjusted above and below the hip-belt.
                I've read some users have purchased Z-packs hip-belt pockets and sewn them on to the Exos, but I've not personally tried it myself.
            </p>

                Another issue I had with the 2018 model was my Bear Vault 450 was significantly sticking out of the back and almost touching the back mesh panel.
                I didn't think much of it at first, but after my trip my back was pretty sore from the Bear Vault.
                I tried re-adjusting the Bear Vault in my backpack, but no matter what I did, I still had the same issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up returning the Osprey Exos 48 2018 model and upgraded to the newest model with the hip belt pockets.
                Despite being slightly heavier, I find this pack to be more comfortable overall and I don't have the same issues I had with the previous model.
                I've only taken it on one trip so far, but so far I've been satisified with it.
