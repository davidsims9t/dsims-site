  <p>
    My name is David Sims. I currently work as a Web Artitect at 2K.
    In my free time I like to hike, mountain bike, backpack, and travel.
    I have a 7 year-old dog named Gizmo whom I hike and backpack with frequently.

    I've decided to compile a list of my
    <a href="/backpacking">backpacking</a>, <a href="/">hiking</a>, and
    <a href="/mountain-biking">mountain biking</a> journeys so it might be helpful for others looking for ideas and reviews.
    I also have a list of my current <a href="/gear">gear</a> and other gear I've used in the past.
